# Goals

Analyze the business relationships between autonomous systems (ASes), and then classify these ASes into multiple categories.

# Task 1

* Duplicate ASes and AS paths are removed with java.util.HashSet.
* See bgpvis.etl.BgpPreprocessor.java, bgpvis.AsPath

## Run Instructions

Run bgpvis.etl.BgpPreprocessor.java with the following VM arguments:
```
-Xms2048m
-Dbgp.in.file="path/to/file"
-Dbgp.out.file="path/to/file"
```

# Task 2

* Get the neighbours of each AS, then count the neighbours (node degree).
* Insert node degree and a set of ASes that share the same node degree into a java.util.TreeMap, so that the ASes can be sorted by the key (node degree). 
* Sort the TreeMap in descending node degree and get the top k ASes.
* See bgpvis.NodeDegreeRanker, bgpvis.AsPath, bgpvis.AsGraph

# Task 3

* Assume number of misconfigured BGP speakers L = 1 and degree size ratio R = 60. L and R are the same configuration as in Gao (2001). 
* Implementation based on Algorithms 1 and 2 given in the assignment paper.
* Guavaâ€™s Multiset is used to count the number of transit relationships.
* See bgpvis.AsGraph, bgpvis.AsGraphAnnotator

# Task 4

* Prune stubs, then prune regional ISPs from the relationship graph. Remaining nodes are cores.
* No further pruning is performed at this point. 
* Transit cores are those that peer with dense cores and other transit cores. So I call the method recursively to check whether the neighbour of a transit core is also a transit core.
